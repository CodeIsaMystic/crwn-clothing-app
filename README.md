A complete project... called "crown-clothing"



1- Reading & Visualizing the Design
  - fast visual of what we need, what we want to do 
  - thinking on components, reusable components

  => The design is here nice but but also simplifyed, because it's not the purpose. So, we start with a simple Header, then a kinfd of image navigation on categories
  => If we focus on the nav, we want here to build an "image-card component" which we will positioning on different way.  

  2- Building the homepage first as a Component itself:
    - build the html struct on homepage.component.jsx file for the 5 items menu 
    - export default
